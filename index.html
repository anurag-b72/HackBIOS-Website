            The Shri Shankaracharaya Technical Campus in Bhilai, Chhattisgarh,
            India, orchestrated the HackBIOS event. The previous offline
            hackathon was an enjoyable experience as it accommodated over 100
            teams of four members each. This time around, we aim to
            incorporate school students in order to expose them to the latest
            technologies and the tech community, thereby sparking their
            interest in the field. Additionally, it will provide college
            students with the chance to be recruited by various corporations.

          <h2>Problem Statements</h2> <br>
          <p class="para">1. Limited access to sustainable farming technologies in rural areas results in reducedcrop
            yields and food insecurity. This is due to several factors, including the highcost of
            modern farming equipment, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to financing. These challenges can
            lead to lower yields and less productive farms, contributingtofood insecurity and economic hardship for
            farmers.
            <br><br>
            2. Inefficient food distribution systems lead to high food waste and prices, creatingfoodaccess and
            affordability problems. Food waste occurs at different stages of the supplychain, from harvest to
            distribution, and from retail to consumer. Poor logistics andtransportation systems, and a lack of proper
            storage and preservation technologies alsocontribute to waste. This wastes resources and increases the cost
            of food for consumers.
            <br><br>
            3. Over-reliance on chemical fertilizers and pesticides has led to environmental
            degradation and health hazards. The overuse of chemicals can lead to soil depletion, water pollution, and
            health hazards for farmers and consumers. Chemicals alsoharmbeneficial insects and pollinators, which can
            further reduce crop yields and damageecosystems.
            <br><br>
            4. Small-scale farmers lack adequate training on sustainable farming practices andtechnology adoption,
            limiting their productivity and efficiency. Small-scale farmers oftenlack access to the latest farming
            techniques, innovations, and technologies. Inadequateeducation and training can lead to lower yields and
            reduced profitability, makingit
            challenging to sustain their livelihoods.
            <br><br>

            5. Urban areas often have limited access to affordable and nutritious food options, leading to health and
            wellness concerns. Urbanization has led to increased demandfor
            food, but the proximity of cities to farms has decreased, leading to food scarcity and
            higher prices. Many urban areas also lack access to fresh, locally produced, andnutrientrich food options,
            leading to health problems.
            <br><br>
            6. Climate change has disrupted traditional weather patterns, resulting in unpredictablecrop yields and
            affecting food production. Climate change has led to more extremeweather conditions, including floods,
            droughts, and heatwaves, which can destroycrops, affect soil quality, and increase pests and diseases. These
            effects can threaten foodproduction and food security.
            <br><br>
            7. Inadequate investment in research and development of new farming technologiesandpractices has limited
            productivity and efficiency gains. There is a lack of investment inresearch and development of new farming
            technologies and practices to address
            challenges faced by farmers. This has led to stagnation in productivity gains andlowprofitability, making it
            challenging for farmers to sustain their livelihoods.
            <br><br>
            8. The underuse of data-driven decision-making in agriculture results in suboptimal
            resource allocation and reduced productivity. The underuse of data-driven decision- making tools, such as
            precision agriculture, can limit productivity gains and leadtosuboptimal resource allocation. Lack of data
            sharing and poor data quality alsocontribute to low productivity.
            <br><br>
            9. Fragmented food supply chains and a lack of transparency and accountability inthefood system can result
            in food safety concerns and other issues. Fragmented foodsupply chains can create gaps in the system,
            leading to quality issues and supply chaindisruptions. A lack of transparency and accountability in the food
            systemcan leadtofood safety concerns, traceability issues, and other problems.

          <h2>Problem Statements</h2> <br>
          <p class="para"> 1. The lack of pedagogical training among educators is a
            major challenge in the implementation of smart education and learning
            technologies, as the complex integration of technology with traditional
            teaching methodologies demands advanced skillsets beyond the grasp of
            most teachers.
            <br>
            <br>
            2. The deployment of smart education and learning
            technologies in low-income communities is hampered by the high cost of
            access and maintenance, compounded by the challenge of securing funding
            from reluctant public entities and private investors.
            <br>
            <br>
            3. The advancement of smart education and learning
            technologies is impeded by the inadequate infrastructure in remote areas,
            where power supply and high-speed internet are scarce, and the cost of laying
            down necessary infrastructure to implement the latest technologies is
            exorbitant.
            <br>

            <br>
            4. The detrimental impact of increased screen time due to
            smart education and learning technologies on students' physical and mental
            well-being poses a serious challenge, with little mitigation available in the
            absence of proven alternatives.
            <br>
            <br>
            5. The proper handling and use of data generated by smart
            education and learning technologies is an increasingly complex challenge in
            the face of evolving privacy laws, increased cybersecurity risks, and a shortage
            of personnel with the necessary expertise to effectively manage and safeguard
            data.

            6. The effectiveness of smart education and learning
            technologies is hampered by the lack of consistency and standardization in
            the design of digital educational materials, as well as the varying levels of
            competence and expertise among educators tasked with implementing these
            materials
            <br>
            <br>
            7. The potential negative impact of smart education and
            learning technologies on students' cognitive development and non-digital
            skills represents a significant obstacle, particularly as there is limited research
            on how to balance the use of technology with traditional educational
            methods.
            <br>
            <br>

            8. The rapid pace of technological innovation and the
            complexity of emerging technologies creates a daunting challenge for
            educators, who must continually adapt their teaching methodologies to keep
            pace with new developments and integrate them effectively into the
            curriculum.
            <br>
            <br>
            9. The digital divide created by the uneven distribution of
            smart education and learning technologies among different socioeconomic
            groups presents a formidable obstacle to achieving educational equity,
            particularly in the face of mounting pressure to close achievement gaps and
            improve learning outcomes.

          <h2>Problem Statements</h2><br>
          <p class="para">1. No direct access to the patient's health: The offline healthcare systems are not
            sustainable, and many people cannot afford primary healthcare and rely on the ER for routine check
            ups. Health professionals lack the time and devices to provide direct care to every patient.
            <br><br>
            2. Siloes in the Healthcare World: Healthcare professionals are disconnected and
            working in silos. A missing platform can bring the healthcare industry to a single page, where they
            can discuss their learning, share knowledge, and create notes. Things could get better if there were a
            single platform exclusively for the healthcare sector. Everyone can learn from everyone, leading to a
            better understanding, diagnosis, and treatment.
            <br><br>
            3. Issues with Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement; Medicare and Medicaid
            are government healthcare programs that provide healthcare coverage to patients. Their repayment
            structures vary significantly and need to maintain an orchestrated management process. The
            procedures for filing and receiving Medicare and Medicaid are very different and are an extra task on
            the to-do list of healthcare professionals. The regulations also need them to store and record patient
            records in a particular format for the services rendered.
            <br><br>
            4. Absence of Supply Management System: As patients, we never think of the
            logistics behind healthcare services. But they form the backbone of the industry. Efficient logistics
            practices ensure smooth healthcare services. However, managing these logistics is still a tricky task.
            <br><br>
            5. Invest in Data Management Systems: To avoid heavy losses and spending
            unnecessarily, it's imperative to turn to digital healthcare technology providers for a powerful and
            effective solution. Invest in an inventory or warehouse management system at the higher end of
            supply chain management.
            <br><br>
            6. Managing the Massive Volumes of Patient-Related Data; Patient-related data
            is one of the most overwhelming aspects of healthcare. With each new addition to the patient
            database, the existing data pool still becomes bigger. Consequently, it becomes even tougher to
            manage this data. As much as we expect the traditional infrastructure to manage and secure the
            data, it is only unrealistic.
            <br><br>
            7. Inefficiencies and Errors in Data Sharing : In an age where medical science has
            made noteworthy advancements, inefficiencies and healthcare errors are still persistent because of
            the healthcare industry's traditional technology for management. This is not just a hurdle in medical
            science; it causes regression because of the waste it generates. Not only do patients pay the price in
            the form of inconvenience and health, but we also see a rise in administrative expenses and litigation
            owing to these inefficiencies.
            <br><br>
            8. No early warning healthcare devices: Diseases like cancer, as well as events
            like aneurysms and strokes, frequently catch doctors off guard. It is often too late to do much, and
            many patients die not because they cannot be saved but because it is too late to save them. The new
            smoking is sitting, and lifestyle diseases are on the rise. Lifestyle diseases include cancer, diabetes,
            obesity, heart disease, and kidney disease. IoMT can manage the risk of suffering from all of these.
            <br><br>
            9. Slow pace with modern solutions:Our knowledge is limited. We need to learn
            more about the mechanisms underlying the various diseases caused by viral infections. A small
            change in human DNA can help prevent a variety of ailments.

          <p class="para"><b>" Travel time and traffic flow optimization in India " :</b> <br>
            Traffic congestion on roads not only increases the fuel consumption but consequently leads to
            increase in carbon dioxide emissions, outdoor air pollution as well as increase in the exposure time
            of the passengers. There are constraints on making large scale additions/ improvements to the road
            infrastructure. There is also no baseline against which the quality of the traffic flow in town or any
            other city could be measured on any given day. This problem is looking for optimization solution of
            Traffic flow in any City through Traffic Flow Analysis using open-source data as well as development
            of a dashboard to objectively monitor the quality of traffic flow in a city on a given day. The objective
            analysis solutions will help to both monitor and manage traffic congestion and emissions through
            better utilisation of the available infrastructure and help identify the low hanging fruit infrastructure
            bottlenecks addressing which will lead to an immediate improvement in the traffic flow in the city.
            <br> <br>

            <b>" Smart driver training problem for attitudinal change ":</b> <br>
            While there has been a lot of emphasis given on Road Safety information by Traffic Police and other
            stake holders yet an attitudinal change with willingness to adhere to traffic rules that impact safety
            has not been achieved. There is a need to devise programmes and interventions that bring about an
            attitudinal change in the citizens.
            <br> <br>

            <b>" Parking Management following system approach for the city " :</b> <br>
            Parking is a major problem in urban areas in both developed and developing countries. Following the
            rapid incense of car ownership, many cities are suffering from lack of car parking areas with
            imbalance between parking supply and demand which can be considered the initial reason for
            metropolis parking problems. This imbalance is partially due to ineffective land use planning and
            miscalculations of space requirements during first stages of planning. Shortage of parking space,
            high parking tariffs, and traffic congestion due to visitors in search for a parking place are only a few
            examples of everyday parking problems. We are looking for solutions proposing effective parking
            system and its optimum utilization within cities.
            <br><br>

            <b>" Low-cost urban space transformation for the vulnerable road users like pedestrian and cyclists. ":</b>
            <br>
            In Indian cities, the focus on car-centric infrastructure, traffic congestion, narrow roads, and a
            general disregard for cyclists and pedestrians has created an environment that favours motorised
            transport over walking and cycling. Re-purposing streets to ensure equitable distribution among
            road users and focusing on the most vulnerable users like cyclists and pedestrians are key to creating
            a bicycle-friendly environment. However, in India's space constrained cities, there are practical
            limitations on creating more infrastructure. Thus, while encouraging bicycle and pedestrian
            transportation in cities is a laudable objective, however from the standpoint of the traffic police,
            there is a need for a plan or idea to adopt pro-pedestrian and cyclist policies without compromising
            safety. Therefore, to manage the above, we are looking for some better ideas from you all.
            <br><br>

            <b>" Innovation for improving occupational safety health for traffic Personnel ":</b> <br>
            Traffic management and regulations is still manpower intensive and heavily dependent on having
            feet on ground. This exposes the Traffic personnel to high levels of air and noise pollution,
            discomfort due to weather and stress. Therefore, there is an urgent need for innovation to improve
            the occupational safety health of traffic personnel. We are looking for innovative and smart ideas
            from you all to help the traffic police of your city.
            <br><br>

            <b>" Vigilance and Integrity monitoring of traffic personnel "</b><br>
            Preventive vigilance is one of the tools in ensuring the integrity in public governance. With the
            advent of smart phones and other gadgets there is a need to innovate on technical solutions that
            help promote greater integrity and transparency in the service delivery by Govt. functionaries
            including Traffic Personnel.
            <br><br>

            <b>"Safer Vehicles":</b><br>
            Under this theme, participants are required to brainstorm and develop solutions to reduce the
            crash occurrence frequency and reduce the impact of the crash in case a crash happens. Possible
            innovations (but not limited to) could be a vehicle fitness check device, fatigue analyser, mechanism
            to ban underage driving, etc.

            <b>"Emergency Connect":</b><br>
            Working on a web/tool that can improve the post-accident emergency space in India. From working
            on making, it makes easy for the victims to claim financial support to the process of getting an
            ambulance on time- there is a lot of gaps in the space that can be worked upon by using technology
            to improve the same.
            <br> <br>

            <b>"Carpool system"</b><br>
            Carpooling is the easiest and most common ridesharing arrangement. Promoting more efficient
            carpooling can not only help with urban traffic decongestion, but will also go a long way towards
            reducing environment impact by cutting down emissions and idling . Design a car-pooling system
            which takes into account of the points of start and stop of the commuter and availability of cars at
            that particular point of time to match with available vehicles.
